<h2 align="center">👨‍💻 About Me</h2>


> I’m a software and electrical engineer passionate about solving complex problems through practical, creative solutions. Currently, I’m a degree apprentice at <b>Airbus Defence and Space</b>, where I combine hands-on engineering with academic learning. This balance has shaped the way I approach challenges: breaking them down, working collaboratively, and always keeping the bigger picture in mind.

<br/>

<details>
<summary>More about me</summary>

Alongside my professional and academic journey, I’ve founded and contributed to several businesses. Each venture has taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of building technology that genuinely makes an impact.

What drives me most is curiosity. I love experimenting with new ideas, bridging hardware and software, and turning concepts into working systems. Whether in aerospace, entrepreneurship, or personal projects, I’m motivated by the opportunity to keep learning and to build things that matter.
